This folder contains Figma-extracted static assets (HTML/CSS/JS) and images under figmaimages/ to allow Angular to serve them statically.
- Access the static demo via /assets/contact-1-514.html when running the dev server.
- Images resolve via /assets/figmaimages/*.
- When adding new images, place them under this folder so Angular can serve them without additional configuration.
